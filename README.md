## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This presentation gives an overview of the Employee Management System SQL project. 
This project is designed to make handling employee data easier and more organized. 
Key queries are shown with simple explanations to make data management easy to understand. 
The focus is on insights into employee data, payroll, salary, bonus, department analysis, roles, and leave management.

## OBJECTIVE

To design and implement a system that efficiently stores and manages employee-related data.
To track employee information including personal details, job roles, salary, qualifications, leaves, and payroll..
